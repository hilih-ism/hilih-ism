        Welcome to my About Me page! I'm a passionate web developer with a
        love for creating beautiful and functional websites. I have a strong
        background in front-end development using technologies like React, and
        I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="font-primary text-gray-700 mt-4">
        In my free time, I enjoy coding personal projects, learning new
        programming languages, and sharing my knowledge through blog posts and
        tutorials. I'm dedicated to making the web a better place, one line of
        code at a time.
